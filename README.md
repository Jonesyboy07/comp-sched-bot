# Game Schedule Bot

A simple bot that allows users to schedule games within their teams!

## **Features**:

- Allow the "Administrator" of a server to set the initial server up.
- Add basic commands, with help system detailing each command
- More Soon!

### **Open Source**:

Some people may want to add their own features, and want these for themselves. Due to this, most of the source code is open. If you wish to replicate this, I kindly ask that you keep in my creditation in some way. This is a project I have tried multiple times and fight dearly for.

You are free to clone this repo and run it yourself, check for more details on this further below.

### **Pricing**: 

With other projects *cough cough* *no names here* *cough cough* requiring a user to **pay** for using their project, i wanted to make a **free** version. This wont cost at all, but donations are welcome on my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/jonesy_alr) page.

### How to run independently

1. Clone/Download the project.

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the folder to install all required packages.

3. Edit the `.env.example` and rename to `.env`.

4. Run the `prereq.py` file to ensure any JSON files needed are made.

5. Edit the `data/commands.json` with adequate descriptions for your project.

6. Run `main.py` to start the bot!


### Notes:

The majority of this code is handwritten. In some places, AI was used to:

- Fix errors

- Implement complicated features

- Streamline important parts
